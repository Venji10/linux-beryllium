QCOM WCD9340/9341 Codec Bindings

Qualcomm WCD9340/WCD9341 Codec is a standalone Hi-Fi audio codec IC, supports
Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI) multimedia solutions, including
the MSM8996, MSM8976, and MSM8956 chipsets. It has in-built
Soundwire controller, interrupt mux. It supports both I2S/I2C and
SLIMbus audio interfaces.
