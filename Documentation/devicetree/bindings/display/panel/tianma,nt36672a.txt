Tianma model NT36672A DSI display driver

The Tianma NT36672A is a generic display driver, currently only configured
for use in the Poco F1 phone based on SDM845 chipset.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "tianma,nt36672a"
- reg: DSI virtual channel of the peripheral
- vddio-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  Power IC supply
- lab-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  for lab LABIBB
- ibb-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  for ibb LABIBB
- reset-gpios: phandle of gpio for reset line
  This should be 8mA, gpio can be configured using mux, pinctrl, pinctrl-names
  (active high)
- pinctrl-names: Pinctrl for panel active and suspend
- pinctrl-0: Active pinctrls
- pinctrl-1: Suspend pinctrls
- ports: This device has one video port driven by one DSIs. Their connections
  are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
  - port@0: DSI input port driven by master DSI

Example:

	dsi@ae94000 {
		panel@0 {
		compatible = "tianma,nt36672a";
		reg = <0>;
		vddi0-supply = <&vreg_l14a_1p88>;
		lab-supply = <&lab_regulator>;
		ibb-supply = <&ibb_regulator>;

		reset-gpios = <&tlmm 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;
		
		pinctrl-names = "panel_active", "panel_suspend";
		pinctrl-0 = <&sde_dsi_active>;
		pinctrl-1 = <&sde_dsi_suspend>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				tianma_nt36672a_in_0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&dsi0_out>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
	};
