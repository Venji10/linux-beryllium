LG model SW43408 DSI display driver

The LG SW43408 is a generic display driver, currently only configured
for use in the Pixel3 phone based on SDM845 chipset.

Required properties:
- compatible: should be "lg,sw43408"
- reg: DSI virtual channel of the peripheral
- vddi-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  Power IC supply
- vpnl-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  for positive LCD bias
- lab-supply: phandle of the regulator that provides the supply voltage
  for LABIBB
- reset-gpios: phandle of gpio for reset line
  This should be 8mA, gpio can be configured using mux, pinctrl, pinctrl-names
  (active high)
- ports: This device has one video port driven by one DSIs. Their connections
  are modeled using the OF graph bindings specified in
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt.
  - port@0: DSI input port driven by master DSI

Example:

	dsi@ae94000 {
		panel@0 {
		compatible = "lg,sw43408";
		reg = <0>;
		vddi-supply = <&vreg_l14a_1p88>;
		vpnl-supply = <&vreg_l28a_3p0>;
		lab-supply = <&lab_regulator>;

		reset-gpios = <&tlmm 6 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

		ports {
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			port@0 {
				reg = <0>;
				lg_sw43408_in_0: endpoint {
					remote-endpoint = <&dsi0_out>;
				};
			};
		};
	};
	};
