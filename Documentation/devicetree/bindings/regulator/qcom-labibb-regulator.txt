Qualcomm's LAB(LCD AMOLED Boost)/IBB(Inverting Buck Boost) Regulator

LAB can be used as a positive boost power supply and IBB can be used as a negative
boost power supply for display panels.

Main node required properties:

- compatible:			Must be:
				"qcom,lab-ibb-regulator"
- #address-cells:		Must be 1
- #size-cells:			Must be 0

LAB subnode required properties:

- reg:				Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator.
- interrupts:			Specify the interrupts as per the interrupt
				encoding.
- interrupt-names:		Interrupt names to match up 1-to-1 with
				the interrupts specified in 'interrupts'
				property.

IBB subnode required properties:

- reg:				Specifies the SPMI address and size for this peripheral.
- regulator-name:		A string used to describe the regulator.
- interrupts:			Specify the interrupts as per the interrupt
				encoding.
- interrupt-names:		Interrupt names to match up 1-to-1 with
				the interrupts specified in 'interrupts'
				property.

Example:
	pmi8998_lsid1: pmic@3 {
		qcom-labibb-regulator {
			compatible = "qcom,lab-ibb-regulator";
			#address-cells = <1>;
			#size-cells = <0>;

			lab_regulator: qcom,lab@de00 {
				reg = <0xde00>;
				regulator-name = "lab_reg";

				interrupts = <0x3 0xde 0x0 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
				interrupt-names = "lab-sc-err";
			};

			ibb_regulator: qcom,ibb@dc00 {
				reg = <0xdc00>;
				regulator-name = "ibb_reg";

				interrupts = <0x3 0xdc 0x2 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
				interrupt-names = "ibb-sc-err";
			};

		};
	};
