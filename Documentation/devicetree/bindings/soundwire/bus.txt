SoundWire bus bindings.

SoundWire is a 2-pin multi-drop interface with data and clock line.
It facilitates development of low cost, efficient, high performance systems.

SoundWire controller bindings are very much specific to vendor.

Child nodes(SLAVE devices):
Every SoundWire controller node can contain zero or more child nodes
representing slave devices on the bus. Every SoundWire slave device is
uniquely determined by the enumeration address containing 5 fields:
SoundWire Version, Instance ID, Manufacturer ID, Part ID and Class ID
for a device. Addition to below required properties, child nodes can
have device specific bindings.

Required property for SoundWire child node if it is present:
- compatible:	 "sdwVER,MFD,PID,CID". The textual representation of
		  SoundWire Enumeration address comprising SoundWire
		  Version, Manufacturer ID, Part ID and Class ID,
		  shall be in lower-case hexadecimal with leading
		  zeroes suppressed.
		  Version number '0x10' represents SoundWire 1.0
		  Version number '0x11' represents SoundWire 1.1
		  ex: "sdw10,0217,2010,0"

- sdw-instance-id: Should be ('Instance ID') from SoundWire
		  Enumeration Address. Instance ID is for the cases
		  where multiple Devices of the same type or Class
		  are attached to the bus.

SoundWire example for Qualcomm's SoundWire controller:

soundwire@c2d0000 {
	compatible = "qcom,soundwire-v1.5.0"
	reg = <0x0c2d0000 0x2000>;

	spkr_left:wsa8810-left{
		compatible = "sdw10,0217,2010,0";
		sdw-instance-id = <1>;
		...
	};

	spkr_right:wsa8810-right{
		compatible = "sdw10,0217,2010,0";
		sdw-instance-id = <2>;
		...
	};
};
