Qualcomm SoundWire Controller

This binding describes the Qualcomm SoundWire Controller Bindings.

Required properties:

- compatible:		Must be "qcom,soundwire-v<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<STEP>",
	 		example:
			"qcom,soundwire-v1.3.0"
			"qcom,soundwire-v1.5.0"
			"qcom,soundwire-v1.6.0"
- reg:			SoundWire controller address space.
- interrupts:		SoundWire controller interrupt.
- clock-names:		Must contain "iface".
- clocks:		Interface clocks needed for controller.
- #sound-dai-cells:	Must be 1 for digital audio interfaces on the controllers.
- #address-cells:	Must be 1 for SoundWire devices;
- #size-cells:		Must be <0> as SoundWire addresses have no size component.
- qcom,dout-ports: 	Must be count of data out ports
- qcom,din-ports: 	Must be count of data in ports
- qcom,ports-offset1:	Must be payload transport window offset1 of each data port.
			Out followed by In. Used for Block size calculation.
- qcom,ports-offset2: 	Must be payload transport window offset2 of each data port.
			Out followed by In. Used for Block size calculation.
- qcom,ports-sinterval-low: Must be sample interval low of each data port.
			Out followed by In. Used for Sample Interval calculation.
- qcom,ports-hstart:	Must be number identifying lowerst numbered coloum in
			SoundWire Frame, ie left edge of the Transport sub-frame
			for each port. Values between 0 and 15 are valid
			Out ports followed by In ports.
- qcom,ports-hstop:	Must be number identifying highest numbered coloum in
			SoundWire Frame, ie the right edge of the Transport sub-frame
			for each port. Values between 0 and 15 are valid
			Out ports followed by In ports.
- qcom,dports-type: 	Must be data one of the following
			0 for reduced port
			1 for simple ports
			2 for full port
= SoundWire devices
Each subnode of the bus represents SoundWire device attached to it.
The properties of these nodes are defined by the individual bindings.

= EXAMPLE
The following example represents a SoundWire controller on DB845c board
which has controller integrated inside WCD934x codec on SDM845 SoC.

soundwire: soundwire@c85 {
	compatible = "qcom,soundwire-v1.3.0";
	reg = <0xc85 0x20>;
	interrupts = <20 IRQ_TYPE_EDGE_RISING>;
	clocks = <&wcc>;
	clock-names = "iface";
	#sound-dai-cells = <1>;
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <0>;
	qcom,dports-type = <0>;
	qcom,dout-ports	= <6>;
	qcom,din-ports	= <2>;
	qcom,ports-sinterval-low = /bits/ 8  <0x07 0x1F 0x3F 0x7 0x1F 0x3F 0x0F 0x0F>;
	qcom,ports-offset1 = /bits/ 8 <0x01 0x02 0x0C 0x6 0x12 0x0D 0x07 0x0A >;
	qcom,ports-offset2 = /bits/ 8 <0x00 0x00 0x1F 0x00 0x00 0x1F 0x00 0x00>;

	/* Left Speaker */
	wsa8810@1{
		....
		reg = <1>;
	};

	/* Right Speaker */
	wsa8810@2{
		....
		reg = <2>;
	};
};
